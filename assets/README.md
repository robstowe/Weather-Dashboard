## Weather-Dashboard
A weather dashboard to check the current and 5-day Forecast for requested cities! 
Type in a desired city within the Search Bar and the weather forecast will be populated to the right. 

Recent Searches are intended to be stored below but I could not peice together that functionality. 

Within Local Storage, you can find the most recent search. Again, this is intended to save all searches but hoping for guidance on how to correct this.
